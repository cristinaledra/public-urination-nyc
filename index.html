			New York City has a small amount of available public bathrooms compared to many other U.S. cities, but the number of summons issued by NYPD for public urination has seen a sharp increase since 2022.

		<!--<section class="content-block">
			<h2>His top issue is the environment</h2></!-->
			<p> The lack of available and well-maintained public bathrooms has been a problem in New York City for decades. While little progress has been made, enforcement of public urination laws has seen a spike under mayor Eric Adams. </p>

<p>Since he took office in 2022, Adams has championed quality of life efforts. And cracking down on such offenses like public urination is one of them. However, complaints to 311 about public urination have largely remained steady since 2018.</p>

<p>Adams announced the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/441-24/mayor-adams-launches-ur-luck-new-effort-make-nyc-public-restrooms-more-accessible-#/0" target="_blank">“Ur In Luck” initiative</a> in June 2024 that aims to build 46 new public restrooms and renovate 36 others in the city over the next five years. He also introduced a Google Maps layer that allows anyone to view where the city’s public restrooms are located.</p>

<p>The Google Maps layer lists 931 public bathrooms in New York City. In a <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/discomfort-stations-the-conditions-and-availability-of-nyc-parks-bathrooms/#_edn4" target="_black">2019 report by city comptroller Brad Lander,</a> the 1,400 public bathrooms available then ranked New York City 93rd nationally in public restrooms per 100,000 residents. Around 400 of those bathrooms had some level of disrepair or inadequacy. While the top city on the list, St. Paul, Minn., had 210 public restrooms per 100,000 residents, New York City had just 16.</p>

<p>“The availability of public bathrooms has not increased significantly since the 1970s crisis years,” said Julie Chu of Urban Design Forum. “We believe the city has not truly recovered from this era, both in stigma around public bathrooms, but also in its commitment to truly rebuild the large network of public bathrooms it once had. Despite city population growth, economic growth, and millions of tourists visiting the city annually, bathroom conditions have changed very little.”</p>

<p>Although New York City once had a robust network of public bathrooms up until the 1930s, many fell into disrepair during the city’s budget crisis in the 1970s and became places where crime and disorder were common.</p>

<p>During her research, Chu found that other large cities around the world have come up with a number of solutions to make more public bathrooms available. Those include local governments paying private businesses to make their restrooms available to the public and installing stainless steel bathrooms that are more easily maintained than traditional public bathrooms. Some are even self-cleaning and would be available around the clock, unlike many public and private options which have opening and closing hours. Advertising could also be added to single stall bathrooms to help pay for operating costs.</p>

<p>In 2002, city council passed a bill requiring city officials to identify one location per zip code for a public restroom. But until there is at least one available and adequate public bathroom in every zip code in the city, New Yorkers and tourists alike are at a higher risk of being ticketed if they choose to relieve themselves in a public place without finding a bathroom.</p>

			<h2>He is a strong proponent of congestion pricing</h2>
			<p>
				Although the implementation of congestion pricing aims to reduce traffic in Manhattan, which proponents say would have a positive impact on air quality, Hoylman-Sigal brought forth another argument in its favor. He produced a report with Sam Schwartz (Gridlock Sam) that painted the need for congestion pricing as a life or death issue because of response times of emergency vehicles. </p>
				<p>In the report, he wrote about his experience calling 911 for a man in pain in Chelsea and waiting 37 minutes for an EMT to arrive. He also included data showing that traffic in the city’s central business district has slowed over the past decade to record lows and that emergency response times have lengthened in that time.

			<h2>He is against shelter limits for migrants</h2>
			<p>
				In an op-ed for City & State with state assemblywoman Catalina Cruz and advocate Christine Quinn, Hoylman Sigal came out against the Adams Administration’s 30- and 60-day shelter limits for migrant single adults and families, calling the policy unjustifiable and inhumane.</p> 

<p>“The idea that the 30 and 60-day rules are helping our newest arrivals ‘find their footing in New York’ is farcical,” the op-ed read. “These policies have the opposite effect, forcing migrants into a cycle of evictions that leave them in a permanent state of precarity. For families with children, moving from one shelter to another every 60 days means children miss school and switch between multiple institutions throughout the school year, leading to significant learning disruptions and psychological trauma.”

			<h2>He co-sponsored the Adult Survivors Act</h2>
			<p>
				Hoylman-Sigal and state assemblymember Linda Rosenthal sponsored the bill, which removed the statute of limitations on civil actions related to adult survivors of certain sexual offenses. Before it was signed into law in 2022, the statute of limitations was three years.

			</p>
			<p>
			Several high-profile civil cases were filed as a result of the legislation, including those against Sean “Diddy” Combs, former governor Andrew Cuomo, mayor Eric Adams, musician Axl Rose, and actors Jamie Foxx and Cuba Gooding Jr.
